//PROBLEM STATEMENT-
There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top (order does matter).

Example 1:

Input:
n = 4
Output: 5
Explanation:
You can reach 4th stair in 5 ways. 
Way 1: Climb 2 stairs at a time. 
Way 2: Climb 1 stair at a time.
Way 3: Climb 2 stairs, then 1 stair
and then 1 stair.
Way 4: Climb 1 stair, then 2 stairs
then 1 stair.
Way 5: Climb 1 stair, then 1 stair and
then 2 stairs.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 10
Output: 89 
Explanation: 
There are 89 ways to reach the 10th stair.

//SOURCE CODE-

class Solution
{
    public:
    //Function to count number of ways to reach the nth stair.
    int countWays(int n)
    {
        // your code here
        int memo[n+1];
        memo[1]=1;
        memo[2]=2;
        for(int i=3;i<=n;i++){
            memo[i]=(memo[i-1]+memo[i-2])%1000000007;
        }
        return memo[n];
    }
};
