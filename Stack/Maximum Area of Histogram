//PROBLEM STATEMENT-

Find the largest rectangular area possible in a given histogram where the largest rectangle can be made of a number of contiguous bars. For simplicity, assume that all bars have the same width and the width is 1 unit.

Example:-
Input:-
N = 8
arr[] = {7 2 8 9 1 3 6 5}
Output:-
16

Explanation:-
Maximum size of the histogram 
will be 8  and there will be 2 consecutive 
histogram. And hence the area of the 
histogram will be 8x2 = 16.
